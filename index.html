                        &emsp; The earliest traces of music in ancient China date back nearly ten millennia. The sophistication and accuracy within each instrument proved a developing integration of music within social norms. Thousands of years later, archeologists began to find more appreciation for instruments as rulers began to stash musical instruments into their tombs. Ancient China would see a strong emphasis on the development of music and different types of instruments would be invented: drums, bells, panpipes, etc. Bones with inscriptions on how to play such instruments became some the first kinds of documentation of music seen in China.

                        &emsp; During the Zhou-Dynasty (1046 - 256 B.C.), scholars made great contributions to music theory. They classified instruments by their source of materials. Eight different categories were established: hide, clay, metal, stone, gourd, wood, silk, and bamboo. Each of these materials formed a different instrument and thus, a different sound. Hide was used to wrap drums, Clay used to mold Ocarinas, Metal used to craft bells and gongs, Flutes were carved from Stone, and etc. The advances made by Zhou scholars would serve as a strong platform for further studies done by later dynasties.

                            &emsp; During the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. - 220 A.D.), trade around the world opened up. Through the silk road, Chinese merchants traded with neighbors in the Middle East. Through those merchants, China was introduced to a variety of new instruments such as the lute. However, the instrument went through another life of its own as the Middle Eastern instrument was transformed into the Chinese instrument, pipa.

                            &emsp; It wouldn't be until the Tang Dynasty (618-907) when musical entertainment became the norm. Music became a profession and musical academies were established. This newly introduced attitude towards music drew thousands of people from the countrysides to migrate to central China and formally study music. This would eventually evolve into the system of practice we have today where musicians are respected for their talent and are rewarded for their performances.

                                The Pipa is an example of an instrument that was transformed under the influence of Chinese culture. It was originally played horizontally like a guitar but as times changed, an upright position was more preferred. The term "pipa" is in reference to the way the instrument is player. "Pi" is to play forward and "pa" is to play backward - the way a performers' fingers are to pluck the strings.

                                The earliest bells developed in China were made upside down! Bells were originally made to be handheld and facing upwards as the user would strike it. By the Zhou Dynasty, bells were made to be hung from wooden frames. Bells usually came in sets of multiple different - hinting at the level of precision and care towards music in ancient China.
