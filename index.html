                        The earliest traces of music in ancient China date back nearly ten millenia. The sopistication and accuracy within each instrument proved a developing integration of music within social norms. Thousands of years later, archeologists began to find more appreciation for instruments as rulers began to stash musical instruments into their tombs. Ancient China would see a strong emphasis on the development of music and different types of instruments would be invented: drums, bells, panpipes, etc. Bones with inscriptions on how to play such instruments became some the first kinds of documentation of music seen in China.

                        During the Zhou-Dynasty (1046 - 256 B.C.), scholars made great contributions to music theory. They classified instruments by their source of materials. Eight different categories were established: hide, clay, metal, stone, gourd, wood, silk, and bamboo. Each of these materials formed a different instrument and thus, a different sound. Hide was used to wrap drums, Clay used to mold Ocarinas, Metal used to craft bells and gongs, Flutes were carved from Stone, and etc. The advances made by Zhou scholars would serve as a strong platform for futher studies done by later dynasties.

                            During the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. - 220 A.D.), trade around the world opened up. Through the silk road, Chinese merchants traded with neighbors in the Middle East. Through those merchants, China was introduced to a variety of new instruments such as the lute. However, the instrument went through another life of its own as the Middle Eastern instrument was transformed into the chinese instrument, pipa.

                                The Pipa is an example of an instrument that was trasnformed under the influence of chinese culture. This instrument was carved with traditional chinese beliefs such as Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.

                                The earliest bells developed in China were made upside down! Bells were originally made to be handheld and facing upwards as the user would strike it. By the Zhou Dynasty, bells were made to be hung from wooden frames.
